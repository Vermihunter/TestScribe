TestScribe is a tool to automatically generate unit tests for your projects. It supports both project-level generation and
file level test generation. Currently it supports `C++` and the most famous C++ unit testing framework, [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest).

TestScribe does not provide deep code analysis to generate unit tests but offers an easy way to create a skeleton for your tests on directory and file level
that compiles without any further compilation/modification action.

## Usage 

1. Open your C++ project's root directory
2. From the command-palette select `Generate tests for the current file` or `Generate tests for the selected directory` according to your preferences
3. By running the command `cmake -B buildÂ && cd build && cmake --build . && ctest`, the tests should be built, compiled and ran

Example:

Suppose we have a local controller from the MVC design pattern that processes user requests and forwards them to the Model component. A simple class could look like this:
```cpp
struct LocalController : public IController {
    /** ... other methods */

    /**
     * @throws std::invalid_argument if row or col are negative
     */
    virtual bool send_move(int row, int col) override {
        return game->send_move(row, col);
    }

    /* ... other methods */
};
```

For the previous piece of code the following Testing code is generated:
```cpp
/** LocalControllerTest.h - set up the class instance maybe using a Mock object... */
class LocalcontrollerTest : public testing::Test {
public:
    virtual void SetUp() override {
        
    }

    virtual void TearDown() override {
        
    }
};

/* LocalcontrollerSendMoveTest.cpp - test an individual class member method */
class Localcontrollersend_moveTest : public testing::WithParamInterface<std::tuple<bool, int, int>>, public LocalcontrollerTest  {};
    
TEST_P(Localcontrollersend_moveTest, send_moveGeneral) {
    auto param = GetParam();
    EXPECT_TRUE(false);
}

TEST_P(Localcontrollersend_moveTest, ThrowStdInvalidArgument) {
    // auto param = GetParam();
    EXPECT_TRUE(false);
    // EXPECT_THROW(func_call(), std::invalid_argument);
}

TEST_P(Localcontrollersend_moveTest, NoThrowStdInvalidArgument) {
    // auto param = GetParam();
    EXPECT_TRUE(false);
    // EXPECT_NO_THROW(func_call(), std::invalid_argument);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(BehaviorTest, Localcontrollersend_moveTest, 
    testing::Combine(
        testing::Values(std::numeric_limits<bool>::min(), std::numeric_limits<bool>::max(), (bool)(0), (bool)(5)),
        testing::Values(std::numeric_limits<int>::min(), std::numeric_limits<int>::max(), (int)(0), (int)(5), (int)(-113)),
        testing::Values(std::numeric_limits<int>::min(), std::numeric_limits<int>::max(), (int)(0), (int)(5), (int)(-113)))
    );

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(ReturnTypeTest, Localcontrollersend_moveTest, testing::Values());
```

## Features

### Classes and functions

The following list shows what is generated for given C++ constructs:
- Global functions
  - If the function is templated, a GoogleTest typed test suite is generated combining the return type (if non-void) and the function arguments (if any) as template types
  - Otherwise, if the function has no return type (void) and has no parameters, a simple GoogleTest test method is generated having a test name of the functions name with a "General" prefix
  - Otherwise, a parametrized GoogleTest suite class is generated. The parameters are the combination of return type (if non-void) and function parameters deeply described in section [Type conversion](#type-conversion)
- Classes - for every class, there is a base suite class created that is inherited from GoogleTest's class interface. Every other classes that test methods of the class are derived from this base class
  - If the class is templated, all the derived classes that test given functions are templated i.e. a GoogleTest typed test suite is generated for them
  - If the class is non-templated, for each method the same constructs are generated as in case of global functions with the difference of there is a base class that defined the SetUp and TearDown methods
  - Tests are generated only for public methods since that is the main goal of unit tests - to test the classes as interfaces

### File hierarchy

Suppose that the file that is located at `root/include/foo/bar/some.h`:
- Tests for a global function named `add` of this file will be located at `root/tests/foo/bar/some_addTest.cpp`
- Tests for a class named `Point` of this file will be located at `root/tests/foo/bar/Point/PointTest.h` and a public member function `distance` of this class at `root/tests/foo/bar/Point/PointDistanceTest.cpp`

### Autofailing behavior

The generated tests are configured in a way that all of them failed - they contain a `EXPECT_TRUE(false)` statement. The reason behind this decision was to not mislead the user that all of their pass but to notify them that the tests need implementation. 


### Generated tests

- For every method (both global and class methods), a general test case is generated
- If a method throws some exceptions, a `Throw${EXCEPTION_NAME}` and a `NoThrow${EXCEPTION_NAME}` test case is generated for every type that is thrown. Please notice that in C++, any type could go after the throw keyword i.e. `throw "exception"` is a valid expression. TestScribe parses both `doxygen` comments - collects all exceptions defined as `@throws` - and parses the code of the functions i.e. it collects all the types after the `throw` keyword

### Instantiation

Instantiation for different types of tests is done differently:
- If a function has a non-void return type, a `ReturnTypeTest` test suite is generated that contains a `testing:Values()` statement where the user should fill in the return type tests
- For every parametrized suite test class, a `BehaviorTest` test suite is generated. In this case, a `testing::Combine()` statement (that calls the test cases using a Carthesian product of its parameters) is combined with parameters using `testing::Values()`. For C++ primitive types like `int`, a couple of corner case params are by default filled in like `std::numeric_limits<int>::min()` or `0`.

### Building

- TestScribe currently supports only the [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build system. The construct of the files may be not the nicest but it is designed against fault tolerance i.e. a user adding manually new tests and ensuring that they are compiled into the tests.
- A hierarchical CMake build system is defined that collects all C++ files on their current directory and add subdirectories.
- The test files contain include statements to the tested class. To ensure compilation is correct, all the subdirectories inside the `include` directory of the root path are collected

### Type conversion 

TestScribe does not want to play the role of a complete C++ compiler and for that reason it provides the following abstraction:
- auto parameters are converted to std::string instances
- any parameters that are not C++ primitive types or std::string instances are wrapped with std::shared_ptr. The reason for this is that GoogleTest's parameterized tests are template parameters and they don't allow any types that are not copy-constructible. Since we are not providing full project parsing and other parameters could be defined in other files, it is a safety reason to use this method.
- any parameter that contains a reference, is wrapped in a std::shared_ptr instance for the same reason as the point above
- any const modifier is removed (cannot pass to GoogleTest)


## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point:

* `testScribe.testPath`: Specifies the test path relative to the root folder (default `tests`).
* `testScribe.generateForClassPrivateMethods`: Specifies whether tests should be generated for private member methods of a class (default `false`).
* `testScribe.generateForClassProtectedMethods`: Specifies whether tests should be generated for protected member methods of a class (default `false`).


## Extending TestScribe

- TestScribe uses [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) as a parser making it extremely easy to add new languages. It may happen (and happens for sure) that TestScribe does not support all C++ constructs. To add more features, extend the `cpp_better_parser.ts` parser.
- Adding another build system (e.g. [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/)) is possible by implementing the `IBuildSystem` interface and define a logic according to what `TestScribe` will decide which build system to use
- Adding another framework is not so easy, but the templates could be defined inside the `templates/` directory and adding the new framework by implementing the `ITestCreator` interface
- Adding other user preferences could be done by declaring new variables inside the `TestCreatorContext` interface and use according to the needs
